## Introduction

I was facing issues with implementing a Text Editor in React, previously I had a hassle-free implementation in Vue for one of the projects I have on Github. Many things did not work for me. I tried packages like React Slate, React-draft-wysiwyg and more. But, they had dependency related issues. Many of them lacked concrete examples. This package called **'mui-rte'** did work for me at last in this project bootstrapped with create-react-app.

This also has some warnings though which I might address in the future, but I needed a quick solution for the time being.
